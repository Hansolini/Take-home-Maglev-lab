/**
 * This example demonstrates the use of MCP23017 I²C port expanders with rotary
 * encoders, using hardware interrupts so you don't miss any pulses.
 * 
 * @boards  Teensy 3.x
 * 
 * This only works on Teensy boards, and maybe on other ARM boards.  
 * I've tested it using a Teensy 3.2 and a Teensy 4.0.
 * 
 * AVR boards (Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.) don't support I²C inside of interrupt
 * service routines, so there's no way to read the state of the MCP23017
 * inside of an ISR.  
 * The same goes for ESP32 and ESP8266, although there may be ways around
 * this by using alternative I²C drivers or by using FreeRTOS features.
 * 
 * Connections
 * -----------
 * 
 *   - SDA:  MCP23017 SDA
 *   - SCL:  MCP23017 SCL
 *   - 12:   MCP23017 INTA or INTB
 *   
 * Connect up to 8 encoders to the MCP23017's GPIO pins: 
 * the first encoder connects to GPIO A0 and A1, the second encoder connects to 
 * GPIO A2 and A3, ..., the eighth encoder connects to GPIO B6 and B7.  
 * Connect the "common" pins of the encoders to ground.  
 * The built-in pull-up resistors of the MCP23017 will be enabled.
 * 
 * Make sure that the reset and address pins are all configured correctly 
 * (reset to Vcc; A0, A1 and A2 to ground).
 * 
 * If you need more than one MCP23017 with encoders, you can connect their 
 * interrupt pins together. This does result in higher latency, because on 
 * average, half of the total number of MCP23017s have to be polled, which is 
 * relatively slow, and might lead to missed pulses when using a large number
 * of encoders.
 * 
 * Behavior
 * --------
 * 
 * When the position of one of the encoders changes, it is printed to the Serial
 * monitor.
 * 
 * The interrupt pin of the MCP23017 triggers a hardware interrupt on the
 * Arduino. This means that you don't have to manually poll the encoders all
 * the time.
