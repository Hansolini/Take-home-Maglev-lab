This folder contains code related to the off-chip implementation described under "Implementation study: embedded computations" in Chapter 15 - Controller implementation.

All code is included for a direct run of the controller on the Teensy. Included is also a test scheme for the controller to time its performance.
Ten states are generated at random and fed through the code and timed. The times are then written to the serial monitor for saving to a .csv-file
or something.
